# 0h h3110

A summer programmer &amp; STEM endeavor

The [0h h1 game][ohhi] ([github][ohhi-github]) is a logic game to place two color pieces on a board according to a set of rules.  The 0h h3110 summer project develops an automated gaming platform to simulate out large-scale versions of the game, amongst other aspects.

0h h3110 is developed as a client-server model, so that multiple clients can place the color pieces on the board.
